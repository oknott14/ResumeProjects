About Myself
	I am currently a junior attending the University of Maryland College Park. My major is Computer Science with a concentration in Mathematics. Within my major, my interests include application development, big data, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. Personally, I love to fish, ski, surf, listen to music, and read books or articles. I would consider myself a want to be know it all. I hate being out of the loop on a topic of conversation, so I am always trying to learn something new and interesting. Furthermore, I try to always challenge myself. Through my studies at UMD, I have realized that there is no better feeling than conquering a difficult problem. As a Junior, I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2021. Ideally, I would like an internship where I am constantly learning and working in an interactive environment. Whether it is done online or in person, I prefer working as part of a cohesive team with a common goal. I am highly motivated and willing to take on any necessary tasks. 
	
Thank you for considering me, I hope to hear from you soon!
Owen
