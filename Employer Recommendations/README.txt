Above are recommendations from past / current employers, co-workers, and friends. Each document includes a few words and a signature at the end for verification. Of the jobs I have had, I have chosen to include recommendations from the owners of the two companies who had the larges impact on me. For a brief description of what I did, see below:


Princeton Sports (Salesman and Ski Technician)

  Location: 6239 Falls Rd. Baltimore, MD 21209
  Phone: 410-828-1127
  Owners: Paul and Alan Davis
  Manager: Van Branch

  I started working at Princeton Sports my sophomore year of high school. At first, I was glanced over for being too young, but I was persistent and did not take no for an answer. I was first hired to do Ski and Snowboard rentals for the winter. However, I quickly demonstrated that I was capable of more. I began doing research outside of work to learn     more about the products that we sold and was promoted to sales shortly after. I refused to stop there, constantly asking questions to expand what I could do. At the end of the first year, I won a sales competition, taught myself how the basics of being a ski technician, and completely surprised the owners. Paul Davis even told my father at the end of the year, "I was hesitant to hire Owen, but he has proven that he deserves to be here." Over the next five years - working winter breaks after leaving for college - I kept pushing myself. I became a requested salesman many repeat customers. During slow hours, I practiced tuning skis and adjusting bindings so I could help the other technicians when they were being over worked.  I learned how to train new staff members and have now been working there longer everyone in the department. Most importantly, I gained six years of sales, marketing, and communication experience that I would not trade for the world.
