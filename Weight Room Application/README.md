Weight Room

This basic application is designed to bring aspects of social media to working out. The app allows users to create their own workouts, view otherâ€™s workouts, and log their completed workouts for future use. This application uses a firebase database to store each workout and exercise in real time, updating as users add new data. 

Future Additions: 
- Add keywords to workouts to recommend workouts like ones that a user completes.
- Add a rating system to workouts to log which workouts are most popular.
- Update the user interface to allow pictures and videos demonstrating each exercise.
- Improve the log in and registration experience.
- Implement a menu to chose workout types or user history.
- Impliment a scheduling feature for different workouts throughout the week. 
- Add alarms to remind people to stay on their workout schedule.

Note: This project was written by Owen Knott and Omar Shawqi over 4 weeks for a final class project. The guidelines were to design and build a health improvement application. I handled the user interface and many of the activities. Omar focused on the database design and how to store different types of data.
